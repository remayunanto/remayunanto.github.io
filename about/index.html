		<p> As you can see from the enormous title above, my name is Rema Prostinaldo Yunanto. That's me in the picture. Currently, I'm a final-year student majoring in Economics. I made this blog to share my thoughts on recent issues in economics caught my interest. Since it would be Boring City if I only share about those things, I'll blog more about things I enjoy, my life improvement, and more things to come. I'm juggling through several projects at the moment, if you're interested in inviting me on your next projects, please contact me through my personal <a href="mailto:remayunanto@gmail.com">email</a>!</p>
		
		<p>This website will be in continous stage of development as I will learn more about how to maintain and develop it. I'm open to suggestion on things I should take an eye for. I hope you like your stay while you're here! </p>
